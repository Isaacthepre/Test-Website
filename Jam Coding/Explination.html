    <H1 class="ExplanationTitle">How To Hit The Shots You Learned On The "Shots" Page</H1>
    <p class="ForehandBackhand">To start off we will talk about ground strokes. The first of the two ground strokes as you know is the forehand. To hit the forehand you first must identify that the ball is going towards our right side if we are right handed and left side if we are left handed. For the remainder of this explanation I will assume that you are right handed and if you are not then you can invert the instructions. Once we know that the ball is going to your forehand then you must setup for it. To do this you turn sideways and raise your racquet at your side in just your right hand with your normal forehand grip. Once you are in this position you move so that you are standing behind the ball and ready to swing. To accomplish the swing you will quickly move the racquet lower and move it forward through the ball then follow all the way through with your arm and bring it back over your left shoulder. Moving onto the backhand you only hit this shot if you see the ball coming to your left hand side. To begin with you switch your grip from your forehand grip to the continental grip. Once you have the correct grip you will position yourself sideways facing the left side and pull your racquet back with both hands on the handle to be beside your face. Once you are in this position you will move to be behind the ball and swing through it in the same way you swing through on a forehand and follow through over your shoulder just like the forehand. After both of these shots you should recover back to the center or slightly offset from the center just behind the baseline.</p>

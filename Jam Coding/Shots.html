        <H1 class="GroundStrokes">Ground Strokes</H1>
        <p class="GroundDiscs">Ground strokes are the main foundation shots of tennis. These shots include both forehands and backhands. Those two shots are mainly used as shots for defence from the back or if you are moving forward they can be used offensively. To play defensively you would keep hitting cross-court because it is a safer option but if you want to then you can go down the line which is more offesnive but also much more risky.</p>

        <H2 class="VolleysOverhead">Volleys & Overheads</H2>
        <p class="VolleysOverheadDisc">Volleys are the shots you make at the net when the ball does not bounce. It is not a good idea to play defensively at the net because in a prolonged ralley you have the disadvantage. To play a volley correctly you will take advantage of the first ball you are given to pull them off the court by hitting at a large angle away from the player. An overhead is a ball that is very high and you can hit either off of the bounce our out of the air. You will generally hit this ball very hard and potentially make it bounce up very high to get it over the opponent or just hit it hard enough that they are unable to put the ball back in play or give you a chance for another attack.</p>

        <H2 class="ApproachShot">Approach Shots</H2>
        <p class="ApproachDisc">Approach shots are very similar to ground strokes. An approach shot is when you hit either a forehand or backhand while running upwards towards the net. Generally you want to hit this ball towards one of the two back corrners. This will prevent your opponent from hitting the ball back past you with a lot of power and speed. Potentially if you even do well enough then you can win the point off of the approach shot or get a good volley to win the point.</p>

        <H2 class="Serve">Serve</H2>
        <p class="ServeDisc">You can find a good video example of someone serving under the "Serve" tab in your navagation bar. A serve is the first and most important shot of the game. The serve is very hard to do well and you have many options of how to hit it. There are two different types of serve, the Ad side serve and the Deuce side serve. For both servers there are 4 main types of serve those being the flat serve, kick serve, slice serve and top-spin serve. You can also aim in 3 main spots those 3 spots being a body serve, wide serve and T-serve. More on this later but there is also the Second and First serve with the first serve being much faster and harder to return than the second serve but you want to have a much more consistant second serve than first serve. You want your first serve to have a success rate of around 60% and your second should have a 90% or higher succsess rate.</p>

    <p class="GroundDiscs">Ground strokes are the main foundation shots of tennis. These shots include both forehands and backhands. Those two shots are mainly used as shots for defence from the back or if you are moving forward they can be used offensively. To play defensively you would keep hitting cross-court because it is a safer option but if you want to then you can go down the line which is more offesnive but also much more risky.</p>
